                        I have been lucky to have been exposed to lots of interesting things of the years. Some of these
                        I have continued with and enjoy spending time learning and creating things.

                            <p>
                                Both my mother and maternal grandmother have enjoyed painting and they have helped me
                                develop without forcing me into a particular style. Having tried various mediums I settled
                                on acrylics because I like the flexibility and also the rapid progress that can be made.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I showed my first self portrait to a friend, he remarked that it reminded him of the
                                faces on the Thomas the Tank engine program. Not quite what I was expecting but perhaps it
                                triggered a happy memory for him.
                            </p>

                            I particularly like painting landscapes and trying to capture those elusive light effects that
                            the human eye is able to perceive better than a camera lens.

                            <h1>Music</h1>
                            <p>
                                Another passion that has been heavily influenced by people around me has been my love of
                                music. I was fortunate as a youngster to be introduced to various styles of music which
                                has given me a really broad catalogue of styles I drift through depending on how I feel.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I also tried to play various instruments as a child including oboe and piano before I
                                finally picked up a guitar. It was the first instrument I really felt comfortable with
                                and so I continued with it. My brother also enjoyed the guitar and we were lucky to
                                find an amazing local session musician (Jim Knights) who also provided private lessons.
                                We spent many years enjoying lessons together until my brothers ability left me behind
                                and we took lessons separately.

                            <p>
                                In recent years I have been slowly picking up knitting and I really enjoy the relaxing
                                nature of this skill. I'm still in the early stages but I did manage to complete a simple
                                hat that actually fits and keeps my head pretty warm!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have plans to try a jumper next before working up to a fisherman gansey in a local
                                pattern.

                            Another interest that I have picked up is making garments using a sewing machine. One of the
                            many talents my maternal grandmother has which she also enjoyed a successful career doing was
                            dress design. I have learned a lot from her over the years and enjoy making interesting clothes
                            for myself and friends.
