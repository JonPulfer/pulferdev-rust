                As a teen I resisted turning my cycling ability into a full motorbike rider as I knew I would definitely
                not survive my enthusiasm for going fast. To be completely honest, I'm not even sure age has tamed that
                really
                and I still get lost in the adrenalin when grabbing more throttle than needed...

                I have enjoyed touring on bikes and so the natural choice was a classic airhead. I found a reasonable
                R100RT
                and rode many miles with my friend <a href="http://www.trailsoftheunexpected.co.uk/">Mike</a>.

                Speed definitely features in my car interests too and I often switch from a practical car to something
                more...

                Due to the dinghy racing, my last vehicle was definitely aimed more at the practical needs but I think
                I'm
                ready for something fun again now.

                I've been to a few track days over the years as well as various race days. A particular memory is being
                stood on the end of Hangar straight the year Schumacher went off. Being among Damon Hill supporters led
                to a big cheer that quickly fell to silence when Micheal didn't get out of the car quickly. Thankfully,
                on that occasions he was fine.
