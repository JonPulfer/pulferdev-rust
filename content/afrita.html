            <p class="centered">Afrita was completed in 1978 by the Jeremy Rogers boat yard in Lymington. Originally she
                was called Sunrise and then, at some point before 1984, her name was changed. I purchased Afrita from a
                lovely family in Scotland in 2016 and have been enjoying sailing her ever since.</p>

            <p class="centered">I have moved Afrita to Suffolk Yacht harbour to make the most of sailing now I have a
                car. There are some bigger jobs that need attending to such as replacing the standing rigging and
                stainless steel work. At Suffolk Yacht Harbour there are a number of companies on site that are able
                to perform these jobs for me. It also has direct access to the river so I don't spend time waiting to
                lock in or out which will allow me to maximise my sailing time and get out to sea quicker.</p>

            <p class="centered">I'm still building up my offshore experience with the goal to eventually cross oceans.
                My long term dream is to explore the pacific islands. Particularly Galapagos, Hawaii, French Polynesia
                and Fiji before arriving in New Zealand. Like all sailing plans, it's very loosely defined, and I would
                be just as happy to sail round Britain.</p>
