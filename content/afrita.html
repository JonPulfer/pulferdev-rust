            <p class="centered">Afrita was completed in 1978 by the Jeremy Rogers boat yard in Lymington. Originally she
                was called Sunrise and then, at some point before 1984, her name was changed. I purchased Afrita from a
                lovely family in Scotland in 2016 and have been enjoying sailing her ever since.</p>

            <p class="centered">Currently Afrita is berthed at Ipswich Haven marina in the historic dock in town. This
                is only a few minutes walk from home, or to one of the local cafes/restaurants or shops.</p>

            <p class="centered">I'm still building up my offshore experience with the goal to eventually cross oceans.
                My long term dream is to explore the pacific islands. Particularly Galapagos, Hawaii, French Polynesia
                and Fiji before arriving in New Zealand. Like all sailing plans, it's very loosely defined and I would
                be just as happy spending time sailing around the UK!</p>
