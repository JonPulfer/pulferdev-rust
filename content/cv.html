            <h1>Brief Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                tldr;
                I enjoy programming and working in vibrant, energetic teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started in computer systems management as a systems operator. I enjoyed learning and started writing
                scripts to automate many of the processes routinely performed in my day to day duties. This was the
                beginning of my interest in programming. I studied C using the eponymous classic K&R book and many
                online
                resources. Since those early stages, I have continued to research areas that draw my attention and have
                picked up other languages such as Python, Java and most recently Go and Rust.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the last few years I have been enjoying working in projects primarily in distributed, cloud based
                systems and my diverse experiences across many business sectors have helped shape my solutions. Another
                key lesson has been the value of the team around me. I enjoy learning new approaches and helping others
                where I can. I have learned to take criticism well since I recognise this is the best way for me to
                improve the quality of my work.
