                I originally qualified as a wooden boat builder and had no plans to follow a career in
                technology. This all changed when I found that the luxury goods market was collapsing
                and boats definitely fell into this market.

                I had been messing around with various computer based things from an early age and so
                decided to try and make a living from it. I started a course in computer science but
                only managed to complete the first year before life pressed me to get earning. I first
                took a job as an AS/400 operator at Heatrae Sadia. This was a very task focused role
                which soon became tiresome. I decided to look for something a bit more interesting so I
                registered with an agency and started a temporary position at Jeyes in Thetford, UK.

            <p>
                I was really lucky to get that position as my first agency one and the team there were really
                supportive. I got involved in all I could, learning as much as I was able to absorb. It
                was a great time for me and I ended up moving from a temporary contract to a permanent one.

                Anyway, enough of my origin story, here are some of the things I'm messing around with
                at the moment...

            <h1>Rust</h1>
            <p>
                In the last few years I have been developing more systems using the
                <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> language. For
                a lot of the systems I work on, it's a great fit and I really enjoy writing code using it.
            </p>
            <p>
                More recently I have been looking at both WASM and embedded systems and Rust is proving
                to be a really nice fit here too.

            <h1>Go</h1>
            <p>
                I started writing <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> programs fairly early on in it's existence and
                really enjoyed the simple yet productive nature of the language. I still appreciate this and I find it
                compliments Rust really well since where one starts being awkward the other picks up.
            </p>
            <p>
                I mainly use Go when I'm interacting with multiple API services or the system doesn't
                involve very loosely defined data objects.

            <p>
                I'm currently researching building a battle robot as a team effort involving a few
                friends. I am hoping that I can connect with a local high school to get a group together
                to design, build and compete the robot. If it works well, it would be something that would be enjoyable
                to develop further over a few years.
            </p>
            <p>
                My research so far has discovered <a href="https://www.fightingrobots.co.uk/content/22-fra">Fighting Robots Association</a>.
                Which has multiple weight classifications so that experience in smaller robots can be developed before attempting a
                larger build.
