                I really enjoy travelling and exploring new places. A few years back I spent a year living in Italy in
                the town in Friuli which
                maternal grandmother lived in as a child. I still have relatives that live in that area and it was
                really nice
                to be able to get to know them. It also happened that there was great cycling available too, so my
                training rides
                took me into the mountains nearby through vineyards.

                I've also been lucky to have been able to travel as part of work from time to time. Most recently I
                spent some
                time in San Francisco. It was there that I found my favourite work space on the roof of the office. The
                food and art scenes are amazing and I will definitely visit again, perhaps arriving by boat!

                Talking of cities that I really enjoy, I have to mention Copenhagen at this point. If you haven't
                yet had the chance of spending time there, it doesn't disappoint on all the recommendations. I
                particularly
                enjoyed the historic parts of the city including the castles and forts.

                Over the years, I have made many trips to the Lake District. It's one of many parts of the UK that I feel
                privileged to have access to. I haven't taken it to the extreme of trying to complete all of the Wainwright's
                but I definitely refer to those for inspiration for what to climb.
