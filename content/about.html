    I'm a distributed systems programmer (predominantly Rust and Go) living in Ipswich and currently commuting into
    London.
    Although this does mean I travel more than some, it enables me to work with some really interesting
    people using technology that challenges me. I enjoy helping people and fixing things, which provides
    me with plenty to learn and helps keep me energised.

    I'm always happy to hear about new opportunities and welcome connections via one of the social
    accounts in the links above.
