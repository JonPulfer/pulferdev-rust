            <p>
                Sailing is a major passion of mine and for a number of years I have raced a
                <a href="https://phantomclass.org.uk">Phantom dinghy</a>.

                This is a fast single handed hiking dinghy. It's a real handful and has a huge grin
                factor on a reach. It's also seems to have a fairly vindictive nature and has made
                several attempts to drown and generally injure me. Definitely demands respect and seems
                to get jealous easily when time and attention are lacking ...

            <p>
                As a teen I joined my father and brother riding bikes. I raced in a few different
                disciplines (grass, time-trial and later road-racing) and have also ridden some interesting
                mountain passes. Going up mountains is hard work and tiring but the downhill part definitely
                makes it worth the effort.
